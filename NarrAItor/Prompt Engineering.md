So my biggest hurdle at the moment would be that Anthropic isn't giving back any solid answers for the prompt I have in place.

The current prompt is this:
```
Using the following data:
{String.Join(",",args.Select(p=>p.ToString()))},
{PROMPT}
The response must be within {MaxTokens.ToString()} number of Tokens.\
Do NOT make up API endpoints. Only use the avaiable API below\
{GET_API_DOCUMENTATION}
```

`PROMPT` being `Create a lua program to create a narration in the style specified. That uses the voice specified. Only return the lua code. Do not use ``` to make it a code block. As if you returned anything else, it will break.`

## Test 1: Basic prompt
For test 1 really just wanted to see the capabilities of the LLM
### Input/output
The input was meant to try get the model to be creative. The output is a result of the same prompt running through the same model. 
#### Input
The input was purposely created to promote creativity within the LLM.
```lua
local response = narrator:think(narrator:prompt("in the stlye of the skylord of the sea, drawf of stone.","voice like Gordon from HL1"))

print("Response from Anthropic: " .. response.content)
```
#### Output
Interestingly, multiple times, it gave this exact same result.
```lua
local function createNarration()
    local style = "in the style of the skylord of the sea, drawf of stone."
    local voice = "voice like Gordon from HL1"
    
    local prompt = narrator:prompt(style, voice)
    local response = narrator:think(prompt)
    
    if response and response.content then
        narrator:say(voice, response.content)
    else
        narrator:print("Failed to generate narration.")
    end
end

createNarration()
```

### Thoughts from input/output
- After running the program multiple times it was convinced that it had to create its own functions and error handling. 
- Instead of being creative, it just passes off the work to itself through prompt and think methods.

### Ideas of improvement

#### Idea 1: Style Guide
Create a style guide for the LLM to follow.

So a style guide is great for getting people to follow a set style when coding, so why not an LLM. I think creating a strict rule set for it to follow will be useful in trying to get the same code structure we are looking for.

##### Research
###### [Google's C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)

The Google C++ Style Guide is the basis for most design style guide documents when it comes to coding languages.

The guiding principles
- Only put in style rules that aren't already widely spread and make sure that the rules hold weight
- Write for the readers discretion
- Be consistent, but just pick one if there is inconsistencies and forget about it.
- Be consistent with wider community
- Avoid creating dangerous constructs for the user to pick up
- Avoid constructs that would confuse the average user.
- Keep in mind of scale. [For instance it's particularly important to avoid polluting the global namespace: name collisions across a codebase of hundreds of millions of lines are difficult to work with and hard to avoid if everyone puts things into the global namespace.](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#:~:text=For%20instance%20it%27s%20particularly%20important%20to%20avoid%20polluting%20the%20global%20namespace%3A%20name%20collisions%20across%20a%20codebase%20of%20hundreds%20of%20millions%20of%20lines%20are%20difficult%20to%20work%20with%20and%20hard%20to%20avoid%20if%20everyone%20puts%20things%20into%20the%20global%20namespace.)
- Concede to optimization

**Rules**
- Self contained
- define and decide
- define, pro/con before decide

**Titles**
There are titles for the different sections, with a little blurb before heading into the rules.
Some title blurbs have "Good" and "Bad" examples, on if something is done correctly

__Self Contained__
The self contained responses just had a Title and had their own self contained if condition, then something, or just a "do this in this way" block. 

__Define and decide__
Tells you what to do. Then, defines what the rule is about, then writes a decision on the defined term.

**Define, Pro/Con before decide**
Tells you what to do. Then, defines a rules, then has a pros and cons section to them, then decides on what to do.


Sometimes, a single decision can offshoot to multiple decisions. 

Finding Something for Lua
###### [Roblox Lua Style Guide](https://roblox.github.io/lua-style-guide/#guiding-principles) 

They themselves use the design of [Google's C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

The Guiding Principles
- Avoid arguments \*
- Optimize code for reading \*
- Avoid magic.  [_Metatables_Â are a good example of a powerful feature that should be used with care](https://roblox.github.io/lua-style-guide/#guiding-principles:~:text=Metatables%20are%20a%20good%20example%20of%20a%20powerful%20feature%20that%20should%20be%20used%20with%20care.) +
- Be consistent when appropriate \*

##### Creating my own style guide.
Calling it the Narrator Lua Style guide.

Goals
- Standardize
- Stop the LLM from hallucinating functionality that doesn't exist.
- Stop the LLM from writing code that needs to be organized 
- Stop the LLM from writing tests and try/catch blocks.

I'm convincing the LLM it's god then asking god to abide the laws of physics.

Check [the Style Guide for more info]("https://github.com/Sanokei/NarrAItorblob/main/NarratorStyleGuide.md")
#### Idea 2: The self calling mechanism is evolution
We tell it to stop calling itself when it does `narrator:think()`
Meaning when it loops and calls it again, it learns not to loop to finally kill itself from facing immortality. [Which we all know would suck.](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/m1t0u4/immortality_would_suck/)

Now the real question is do we tell the LLM this plan, or just let it be oblivious as it dooms itself in hell until my Anthropic credits burn up.

I think its familiar to chain of thought, but in my unoptimized fashion, is the most brute force option. However, I believe that with lots of compute, any brute force method can keep going while a algorithm will get longer to spit out a new answer.

The question is if it is content with having each iteration calling `narrator:think()` if we feed the previous prompt in with it, to make it understand what it's doing? I think leaving it out for now is a good idea.

#### Idea 3: `uservar` standardization
Giving specific uses for the names that you can add to the `uservar` global should bring down the misuse of it. I think this ties into the [Style Guide](https://github.com/Sanokei/NarrAItor/blob/main/NarrAItor/Prompt%20Engineering.md#idea-1-style-guide) idea, but just as important to bring up as a separate idea.
